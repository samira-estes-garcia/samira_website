              I graduated from the University of Texas with a B.S. in
              Nutritional Sciences (hook ‘em!). I found coding shortly after and
              was elated to be able to channel my love for science in a totally
              different and exciting way! Soon after, I received a full
              scholarship with Out In Tech x Flatiron for Flatiron's Full Stack
              Software Engineering Immersive program. I am now freelancing while
              actively searching for web dev roles and going through Flatiron's
              course!

              I love building mobile and web apps and just find it so satisfying
              to see my creations come to life in real time. The problem solver
              in me loves debugging and the creative in me utilizes a design and
              responsive first approach. When I'm not coding, you can find me
              sipping sweet tea while working on my first novel and soaking up
              some glorious Texas sunshine.
