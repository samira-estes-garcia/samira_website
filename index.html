            I graduated from the University of Texas with a B.S in Nutritional
            Sciences, I learned a lot but ultimately decided it wasn’t for me.
            In February 2019, I enrolled in a Front End web development course
            with Thinkful and graduated in Aug 2019. Soon after, I received a
            full scholarship with Out In Tech X Flatiron for Flatiron's Full
            Stack Software Engineering Immersive program. I am now freelancing
            while actively searching for web dev roles and going through
            Flatiron's course!

            Coding started out as a passion project, a new skill to pick up
            while I was thinking about what to do next. What I thought was going
            to be fun hobby turned out to be the launch of a fun career! I love
            building mobile and web apps and just find it so satisfying to see
            my creations come to life in real time. The problem solver in me
            loves debugging and the creative in me utilizes a design and
            responsive first approach. I am always looking for new opportunities
            and challenges. Contact me at samira.estes.garcia@gmail.com if you
            are interested in working together.
